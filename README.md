# Line_follower

This was my first project for the Nerdvana robotics club, a robot capable of following a predetermined line path on the floor.
This was my first experience with robotics and basic, so the code is not necessarily great.

This was coded in small basic, a derivative of visual basic. The robot was made with components from the mindstorms lego set.
